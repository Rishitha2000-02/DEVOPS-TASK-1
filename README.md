# DevOps Internship Task - Git Conflict Resolution

## Overview

This repository demonstrates Git branching, merging, and conflict resolution as part of my internship task.

## Branches

- **master**: main branch.
- **feature-branch**: additional changes made for demonstration.

## Merge conflict

When I tried to merge `feature-branch` into `master`, there was a conflict in `file.txt` because both branches modified the same line.
